As follow is the work of team VE_CPU-iDEC this year:

## Model Setup
Our model focuses on data extraction of three sets of data: the sum of bond lengths of molecules, the angle between two atoms, and the diagonal of parallelograms. The molecular information mentioned above is all in three dimensions, which can improve our docking model to some extent. In addition, the molecular 3D model we rendered is supported by blender.After counting these three sets of data we will convert them into HSV plots by a certain formula instead of RGB, and according to a lot of research, HSV is better than RGB in data science applications.
